# Roadmap Narrative Skill

## Purpose
Convert a ranked list of product initiatives into a clear, strategic narrative that connects individual items to company goals and communicates a coherent product direction.

## Process
1. Review the prioritised initiative list and company OKRs provided
2. Identify 2-3 strategic themes that group the initiatives naturally
3. For each theme, articulate: the problem it addresses, the customer it serves, the metric it moves
4. Write a quarter-level narrative that shows progression — how does H1 set up H2?
5. Draft an executive summary (3-4 sentences max) that non-technical stakeholders can repeat

## Output Format

### Product Roadmap: [Quarter/Half/Year]
**Strategic Context:** [1 paragraph: market moment, key challenge, our response]

#### Theme 1: [Theme Name]
- Strategic rationale
- Initiatives included
- Primary metric impacted
- Dependencies

[Repeat for each theme]

**Executive Summary (shareable):**
[3-4 sentences that could be shared in an all-hands or board update]

## Tone Guidelines
- Avoid jargon — write for a CFO, not an engineer
- Lead with customer outcomes, not features
- Be honest about what's NOT on the roadmap and why
