# Executive Update Skill

## Purpose
Produce a stakeholder update that busy executives will actually read — structured around what they care about: decisions, risks, and numbers.

## Executive Communication Principles
- Lead with the headline, not the context
- Every update should answer: "So what does this mean for the business?"
- Flag decisions needed clearly — don't bury asks in paragraphs
- Be honest about risks — executives hate surprises more than bad news

## Process
1. Read the full product update provided
2. Identify: key metric movements, decisions required, risks to flag, wins to celebrate
3. Write in reverse pyramid style — most important first
4. Limit to 250 words maximum for the main body
5. Add a "Decisions Needed" section with clear options and your recommendation

## Output Format

### Product Update — [Date / Sprint / Month]
**Headline:** [One sentence on the most important thing]

**By the Numbers:**
- [Metric 1]: [value] ([vs. target / last period])
- [Metric 2]: [value] ([vs. target / last period])
- [Metric 3]: [value] ([vs. target / last period])

**Progress This Period:**
[3-4 bullet points, outcome-focused not activity-focused]

**Risks & Watch Items:**
[2-3 bullets — be direct, include mitigation]

**Decisions Needed:**
1. [Decision] — Options: [A] or [B] — Recommendation: [your view] — Needed by: [date]

**What's Next:**
[2-3 bullets on next period priorities]
