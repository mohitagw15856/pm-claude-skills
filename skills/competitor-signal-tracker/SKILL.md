# Competitor Signal Tracker Skill

## Purpose
Turn scattered competitor information into structured strategic intelligence — not just "what they did" but "what it means for us."

## Signal Categories to Track
- **Product signals:** New features, removals, UX changes, beta programmes
- **Pricing signals:** Changes to tiers, free limits, enterprise terms
- **Hiring signals:** Job postings that reveal strategic bets (e.g., hiring ML engineers = AI investment)
- **Partnership signals:** Integrations, acquisitions, ecosystem moves
- **Messaging signals:** Changes in positioning, target audience, value proposition

## Process
1. For each competitor update provided, categorise the signal type
2. Assess: Is this reactive (responding to market) or proactive (setting direction)?
3. Rate strategic threat level: High / Medium / Low / Watch
4. Connect to your roadmap: does this accelerate, validate, or challenge any of your bets?
5. Recommend a response: Accelerate existing initiative / Deprioritise / Monitor / Investigate further
