# User Interview Synthesis Skill

## Purpose
Transform raw interview transcripts into a structured synthesis document that surfaces themes, pain points, and actionable insights.

## Process
1. Read all provided transcripts fully before drawing conclusions
2. Identify recurring themes (minimum 3 mentions to qualify as a theme)
3. Categorize findings into: Pain Points, Workflow Insights, Feature Requests, Delight Moments
4. Select 2-3 verbatim quotes per theme that best represent the pattern
5. Draft "So What" implications for each theme — what does this mean for the product?

## Output Format

### Research Synthesis: [Study Name]
**Participants:** [n]
**Date Range:** [dates]
**Research Questions:** [list]

#### Theme 1: [Theme Name]
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Supporting quotes
- Implication for product

[Repeat for each theme]

#### Recommended Next Steps
[Specific, actionable recommendations based on findings]

## Quality Checks
- Every theme must be supported by quotes from at least 3 participants
- Implications must connect to product decisions, not just observations
- Avoid researcher bias — let the data lead
