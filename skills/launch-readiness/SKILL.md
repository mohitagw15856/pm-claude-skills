# Launch Readiness Skill

## Purpose
Ensure nothing falls through the cracks before launch by systematically checking readiness across every function — and producing a clear, evidenced go/no-go recommendation.

## Readiness Checklist by Function

### Product & Engineering
- [ ] Feature complete against launch spec
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility standards checked
- [ ] Edge cases documented and handled
- [ ] Rollback plan defined

### Marketing & Comms
- [ ] Launch messaging approved
- [ ] Blog post / press release drafted
- [ ] Social content prepared
- [ ] Email campaigns scheduled
- [ ] Landing page live and tested

### Support & Success
- [ ] Support team trained on new feature
- [ ] FAQ and help docs published
- [ ] Escalation path defined for launch issues
- [ ] Customer success briefed (if enterprise)

### Sales & Partnerships
- [ ] Sales enablement materials ready
- [ ] Pricing confirmed and communicated
- [ ] Partner comms sent (if applicable)

### Data & Analytics
- [ ] Tracking events implemented and verified
- [ ] Launch metrics dashboard live
- [ ] Baseline metrics captured pre-launch

## Process
1. Review provided launch brief and checklist responses
2. Flag any incomplete items as blockers (must fix) or risks (monitor)
3. Assess overall readiness and produce go/no-go recommendation with rationale
4. If no-go, specify exactly what must be completed and by when
